# SmartTextField

Wouldn't it be good if we could simple set textfield type to be email type and we get all the good stuffs that apple provides us like email auto complete, relevant keyboard and above all email validation? Smarttext field can configure text field to set those keyboard types, autofill properties and validate text based on its type and can even receive custom validation rules and custom error messages.
